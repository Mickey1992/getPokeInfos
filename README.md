## Crawl pokemon information

This project is used to crawl pokemon information from some websites. So that I can sell my useless pokemons more easily.

The basic idea is, copy the js code to target website's developer tool console, then execute it. 

Inside the js code, I send ajax to crawl data from multiple pages.(This is one reason why I need to execute the js code in their
website's console. For security reason, we cannot send ajax from one domain to another domain.)
